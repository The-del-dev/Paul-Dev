### 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m Paul—a passionate software engineer on a mission to turn complex challenges into powerful digital solutions. I believe in building products that spark change and create equity across different sectors. 

💬 **Why I chose software engineering:**  
Ever since I realized how deeply technology influences everyday life, I’ve been driven to build tools that solve real problems—not just ship code. Software engineering gives me that power: to diagnose what’s broken in the world and engineer solutions that matter. From revolutionizing healthcare access to empowering artists to earn a living, I see code not just as logic—but as language, impact, and legacy.

🌟 **What inspires me:**  
- Breaking boundaries with tech  
- Empowering communities through entrepreneurship  
- Using data and platforms to shape policy and support grassroots innovation  
- Supporting the creative economy through tech-enabled art monetization  

🎯 **Vision Statement:**  
To become a tech-driven founder who shapes policies through digital infrastructure, launches startups with soul, and empowers underserved communities with transformative platforms.

🧪 **Projects I’m excited to build:**  
- 💊 Healthcare platforms that enhance accessibility and diagnostics  
- 🌾 Agri-tech tools to support small-scale farmers  
- 🎨 Digital art ecosystems for creatives to monetize and thrive  
- 📱 Web & mobile apps that merge tech, storytelling, and social justice
